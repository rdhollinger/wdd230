                Isaiah 53:3-5
            </h2>
            <p>
                He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with greif: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our greifs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

                But because of the priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.
